# Carob

<img align="right" width="350" height="350" src="https://github.com/reagro/carob/raw/master/img/carob.png">

*Carob* creates reproducible workflows that standardize primary agricultural research data from experiments and surveys. Standardization includes the use of a common file format, variable names, units and accepted values according to the [terminag](https://github.com/reagro/terminag) standard. Standardized data sets are aggregated into larger collections that can be used in further research. We do this by writing an *R* script for each individual dataset. See the [website](https://carob-data.org) for more information.

Carob is an open access *Extract, Transform, and Load* (ETL) framework supported by [CGIAR](https://www.cgiar.org/initiative/excellence-in-agronomy/) to support predictive analytics (machine learning, artifical intelligence) and other types of data analysis. 

Contributions are welcome from anyone, and they can be made via pull-requests. Feel free to improve these scripts, or provide new ones. See the [Guidelines for contributors] for instructions on how to write a Carob script, and follow the steps described [here](https://carob-data.org/contribute.html). You can also raise [issues](https://github.com/reagro/carob/issues) on this github site. A good place to discover new data sets is the [Gardian](https://gardian.bigdata.cgiar.org/) website or our [to-do list](https://carob-data.org/todo.html). 

### Get the data

Compiled versions of the dataset can be downloaded from [carob-data.org](http://carob-data.org) and some will eventually be made available on the [carob dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/carob/).

You can also compile your own version by cloning the repo and running 


```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

```{r}
carob_fertilizer <- read_csv("data/compiled/carob_fertilizer.csv")

# SELECT THE DATA OF MAIZE THAT CORRESPONDS TO THE REGION OF NIGERIA
carob_fertilizer<- carob_fertilizer[ which(carob_fertilizer$country=="Nigeria" & carob_fertilizer$crop =="maize") , ]

# Identify the important predictors X that influence the yield
predictors=c('latitude','longitude','N_fertilizer','P_fertilizer','K_fertilizer','yield')

# from the carob_fertilizer select only those columns that will be used into ML algo
carob_fertilizer_ML=carob_fertilizer[predictors]

# Before all clean the NA (to avoid missing values in the statistics) 
# and the remove the duplicate values in the data frame 
# (this comes usually from errors in savings, and it introduce bias since double)
carob_fertilizer_ML <-na.omit(carob_fertilizer_ML)
carob_fertilizer_ML <- carob_fertilizer_ML[!duplicated(carob_fertilizer_ML),]

# Let's see the main statistics in the data

summary(carob_fertilizer_ML)

plot(carob_fertilizer_ML$N_fertilizer, carob_fertilizer_ML$yield)

# See the histograms for every variable (column)
carob_fertilizer_ML %>% gather() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=value)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill="steelblue", alpha=.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~key, scales="free")

```


```
remotes::install_github("reagro/carobiner")
ff <- carobiner::make_carob(path)
```

```{r}
plot(carob_fertilizer_ML$N_fertilizer, carob_fertilizer_ML$yield)
```


where `path` is the folder of the cloned repo (e.g. `"d:/github/carob"`)

### Use

if you use the aggregated data, you can run `carobiner::get_citations(data)` to get references (citations) to the orginal data sets used.
