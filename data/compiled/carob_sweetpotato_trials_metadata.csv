Experiments were set up at Umbeluzi Research Station, 32 km South of Maputo.  A total of 58 clones were evaluated during the dry season of 2006 and 2008. Two treatments were applied for this multi-year trial: full irrigation and without irrigation at the middle of root initiation growth stage. The field layout was a randomized complete block design with three replications. 'Jonathan', 'Resisto' and 'Tanzania' were the check cultivars in each treatment. Data were collected on storage root and vine yields in the field and DM in the quality laboratory using root samples from the fields. Computation of Harvest index, geometric means, drought sensitity index, drought intensity index as well as drought tolerance expression were made from the field data. The analysis of variance, regression and the additive main effects multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analyses, plus phenotypic coefficient of variation and ecovalence were used for dissecting the G×E and assessing the stability of each clone.",sweetpotato_trials,CC-BY-4.0,Cedric Ngakou,"Andrade, Maria; Naico, Abdul; Ricardo, Jose; Eyzaguirre, Raul; Makunde, Godwill; Gruneberg, Wolfgang; Ortiz, Rodomiro (2016).

More than 198,500 seeds from two crossing blocks were germinated and rapidly multiplied for evaluations in observation trials at four breeding locations in Mozambique. Breeding clones with storage root yields above 10 t/ha were advanced to preliminary and advanced yield trials across four sites and for three years. As a result, 64 high-yielding OFSP breeding clones were selected and evaluated in four mega-environments following a randomized complete block design with three replicates at Angónia, Chókwè, Gurué, and Umbelúzi. Field agronomic data and storage root quality data were collected. Data from multi-environment trials were subjected to single site and combined analysis of variance as well as to stability analysis using AMMI and regression.",sweetpotato_trials,CC-BY-4.0,Cedric Ngakou,"Andrade, Maria; Naico, Abdul; Ricardo, Jose; Alvaro, Abilio; Makunde, Godwill; Low, Jan; Ortiz, Rodomiro; Gruneberg, Wolfgang (2017).
