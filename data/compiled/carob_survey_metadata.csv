These variables are used to quantify more than 40 different aggregate indicators on farm household characteristics, welfare, productivity and economic performance. Between 2015 and the beginning of 2018, the survey instrument has been applied in 21 countries in Central America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The data presented here cover the raw data, the indicator calculation code and the resulting indicator values, and can be used to quantify on- and off-farm pathways to food security, diverse diets and reduced poverty of rural smallholder farm households.",survey,CC0-1.0,Robert Hijmans,"-, RHoMIS (2019).

The LDS is designed in a way that data is collected from randomly selected farmers spread uniformly within a KVK (government extension system) domain/district.
